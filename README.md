Why is there a fork of Facebook's [fixed-data-table](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/pull/331)?
====

There's a [scroll bug](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/issues/330) in Fixed Data Table that's causing a [user facing scroll bug](https://github.com/BuildingConnected/client/pull/180#issuecomment-163759904) in the project table.

Until Al's [PR](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table/pull/331) is accepted or this underlying bug is fixed, use this fork.
